Timer that tracks time!

3.27.19
I haven't been tracking my progress until now. But I really think the 2 things
I've been looking for are eventListeners AND Object. Will try to implement these
now.

Concerns:
  Not sure how to clean up my github file. I'm pretty sure I'm going to be
  reworking the code completely, so I'm not sure how nice it'll play when I try
  to push this to master.
